## Overview

FearlessCMS is a lightweight, file-based content management system built in PHP. It features a modular architecture with plugin support, a modern theme system, and three operational modes for different deployment scenarios. The system prioritizes security, performance, and maintainability through proper file ownership and standard permissions. **Recent major updates include a complete transition from Markdown to HTML editing and enhanced export capabilities.**

## 1. Entry Points

- **index.php (Root):** Main frontend entry point; initializes session, routes requests, loads themes, processes HTML content with JSON frontmatter, handles plugin hooks.
- **router.php:** PHP built-in server router for development; routes /admin/*, serves static files, handles session, redirects unauthenticated users.
- **admin/index.php:** Main admin interface entry point; initializes session, handles authentication, routes admin actions, manages CMS mode restrictions, loads admin templates and sections.
- **serve.sh:** Development server script for easy local development setup.

## 2. Configuration System

- **includes/config.php:** Core configuration and constants (PROJECT_ROOT, CONTENT_DIR, THEME_DIR, PLUGIN_DIR, CONFIG_DIR, ADMIN_CONFIG_DIR).
- **config/cms_mode.json:** CMS operational mode configuration (full-featured, hosting-service-plugins, hosting-service-no-plugins).
- **config/config.json:** Site-wide configuration (site name, description, admin path, etc).
- **config/theme_options.json:** Global theme options and settings.
- **config/active_plugins.json:** Currently active plugins list.
- **config/roles.json:** User role definitions and permissions.

## 3. Authentication & Session System

- **includes/session.php:** Centralized session management; session save path in /sessions, secure cookies, unified session for admin/frontend.
- **includes/auth.php:** User authentication; isLoggedIn(), login(), logout(), permission checks, createDefaultAdminUser().
- **config/users.json:** User account storage (JSON array, hashed passwords, permissions).
- **config/admin/users.json:** Admin-specific user configurations.

## 4. Content Management

- **HTML + JSON frontmatter:** Content files are now HTML (.md files converted to HTML) with a JSON frontmatter block for metadata (title, template, editor_mode, parent, etc).
- **Dual-mode HTML Editor:** New WYSIWYG editor with code view mode, automatic content sync between modes, and full shortcode support.
- **Hierarchical structure:** Supports folders/subfolders for nested content; parent/child relationships managed in frontmatter.
- **Content types:** Pages, blog posts, forms, imported WordPress content, plugin-specific data.
- **content/** directory structure:
  - home.md, about.md, blog_posts.json, forms/ (plugin data), form_submissions/, _preview/ (for previews), and subfolders for categories or custom types.
- **Static Export:** export.js provides Node.js-based static site generation with full HTML content processing, parallax plugin integration, and SEO optimization.

## 5. Theme System

- **includes/ThemeManager.php:** Theme management and rendering; discovers themes, loads config, renders templates, manages assets.
- **Modular templates:** Themes use .html.mod files for reusable components (header, footer, sidebar, etc). Included with `{{module=header.html}}` syntax. Page templates use .html.
- **Theme options:** Defined in config.json in each theme; supports text, textarea, select, checkbox, color, image, array. Accessible in templates as `{{themeOptions.key}}`.
- **SASS/SCSS support:** Themes can include SASS/SCSS for advanced styling; compiled to assets/style.css.
- **Current themes:** default, minimal, minimalist, modern-cards, elegant-dark, cyberpunk, custom-variables-demo, heroic, salt-lake, simple-modern, starterscores, vintage, whisperwind, punk_rock.
- **Theme structure:**
  ```
  themes/your-theme/
    ├── templates/
    │   ├── page.html, home.html, blog.html, 404.html
    │   ├── header.html.mod, footer.html.mod, sidebar.html.mod, ...
    ├── assets/
    │   ├── style.css, images/, js/, sass/
    ├── theme.json (metadata)
    ├── config.json (theme options)
    └── README.md
  ```

## 6. Plugin System

- **includes/plugins.php:** Plugin framework and management; supports a robust hook/filter architecture:
  - Hooks: init, before_content, after_content, before_render, after_render, route, check_permission, content, filter_admin_sections, etc.
  - Plugins register hooks with fcms_add_hook(), admin sections with fcms_register_admin_section(), and can add custom routes/content filters.
- **Current plugins:**
  - **blog:** Blog post management and display
  - **forms:** Contact forms and form submissions with comprehensive admin interface
  - **seo:** Basic SEO meta tags and optimization
  - **ecommerce:** E-commerce functionality
  - **wordpress-import:** WordPress XML import functionality
  - **parallax:** Enhanced parallax sections with v2.0 improvements (image coverage fixes, CSS architecture, dark mode support)
- **MariaDB Connector pattern:** Plugins requiring DB access use fcms_do_hook('database_connect') and fcms_do_hook('database_query', ...). DB credentials/config in content/mariadb-connector/config.json.
- **Plugin structure:**
  ```
  plugins/your-plugin/
    ├── plugin.json
    ├── your-plugin.php
    ├── includes/, templates/, assets/, admin/, README.md
  ```
- **Plugin loader:** Only loads plugins listed in admin/config/plugins.json.

## 7. CMS Mode Management

- **includes/CMSModeManager.php:** Manages operational modes and permissions; mode switching, permission checks, feature restrictions.
- **Modes:**

  - hosting-service-plugins: Plugins allowed, no store, includes ad area system
  - hosting-service-no-plugins: No plugin management, only pre-installed plugins, includes ad area system
- **Mode enforcement:** Admin UI, plugin actions, file management, and uploads are restricted based on mode. Navigation adapts to mode.
- **Ad Area System:** Conditional advertising system that displays ads only in hosting service modes, providing professional hosting experience.
- **Detailed documentation:** See CMS_MODES.md for comprehensive mode information and implementation details.

## 8. Admin Interface

- **Handler files:** The admin directory includes comprehensive handler files for different actions:
  - **Content management:** newpage-handler.php, preview-handler.php, filedel-handler.php, filesave-handler.php
  - **Plugin management:** plugin-handler.php, store-handler.php
  - **Theme management:** theme-handler.php
  - **User management:** user-handler.php, newuser-handler.php, edituser-handler.php, deluser-handler.php, pchange-handler.php
  - **System management:** updater-handler.php, role-handler.php, menu-handler.php
  - **Widget management:** widget-handler.php, widgets-handler.php
  - **File handling:** toastui-upload-handler.php, filemanager.php (with bulk operations and pagination)
- **Action-to-template mapping:** Admin actions are mapped to templates (dashboard.php, content-management.php, plugins.php, themes.php, menus.php, site-settings.html, edit_content.php, new_content.php, file_manager.php, users.php, role-management.html, widgets.php, etc).
- **Dynamic admin sections:** Plugins can register admin sections dynamically; navigation and permissions are updated accordingly.
- **Navigation and permissions:** Admin navigation is built dynamically, and access is controlled by CMS mode and user permissions.
- **UI:** Built with Tailwind CSS, modular, and extensible.

### Admin Section System Issues (2025-08)
- **Known Problems:** The admin section registration system has persistent issues with certain actions, particularly the `files` action
- **Symptoms:** Admin sections registered via `fcms_register_admin_section()` may not be recognized by the admin routing system
- **Current Workarounds:** Direct template inclusion and fallback handlers are used for critical functionality
- **Technical Details:** 
  - Admin sections registered in `includes/plugins.php` may not be available when `admin/index.php` processes requests
  - Output buffering conflicts between admin section callbacks and the main admin system
  - Template mapping system can override admin section registrations
- **Impact:** Some admin functionality requires direct template inclusion rather than the intended admin section system
- **Future Work:** Admin section system needs architectural review and refactoring for reliability

### File Manager Implementation Challenges (2025-08)
- **Bulk Operations:** Successfully implemented bulk file deletion with checkbox selection and confirmation modals
- **Pagination:** Added 10-item pagination system for file listings with navigation controls
- **Admin Section Integration:** Attempted to integrate with admin section system but encountered persistent routing issues
- **Fallback Implementation:** Implemented direct function calls as workaround for admin section system failures
- **Technical Implementation:** 
  - File operations: upload, delete, bulk delete, rename with comprehensive security validation
  - UI components: grid/list views, bulk action bars, file previews, responsive design
  - Security: CSRF protection, file type validation, path traversal prevention, MIME type checking
- **Current Status:** Functionality implemented but admin section integration remains problematic
- **Lessons Learned:** Admin section system requires more robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

## 9. Widget and Menu Systems

- **Widget system:** Sidebar widget management; widgets.json in config/ and admin/config/; supports multiple sidebars, widget types, drag-and-drop ordering.
- **Menu system:** Navigation menu management; menus.json in config/; supports hierarchical menus, drag-and-drop editing, and plugin integration.

## 10. Security Features

- **Authentication & session management:** Centralized, secure, unified for admin/frontend.
- **File system security:** Proper ownership (web server user), standard permissions (755/644), path traversal prevention, file type restrictions, directory access controls.
- **Permission management:** Multiple permission backup scripts (fix_permissions.sh, fix_server_permissions.sh, fix_session.php) for security maintenance.
- **Input validation:** File upload validation, content sanitization, XSS/CSRF prevention, SQL injection prevention (for DB plugins).
- **Critical directories:** sessions/, content/forms/, content/form_submissions/, config/, uploads/, admin/uploads/ (all 755, owned by web server user).
- **Security Update Management:** Comprehensive security update and patch management system with automated vulnerability scanning and emergency patch procedures.

## 11. Performance Considerations

- **File-based page caching:** Public (non-logged-in) pages are cached as static HTML files in the `cache/` directory for 5 minutes by default. This reduces server load and improves response times. Cache is automatically cleared when content is updated via the admin interface.
- **Static site export:** export.js provides full static site generation with HTML content support, parallax plugin integration, and maximum performance for CDN deployment.
- **Caching:** Template caching, plugin hook caching, file system caching, session file optimization.
- **Optimization:** Lazy loading of plugins/themes, efficient file ops, minimal DB dependencies, optimized template rendering.
- **Asset management:** Theme asset organization, static file serving, image optimization, JS/CSS minification.

## 12. Development and Build Tools

- **CRUSH.md:** Comprehensive build, lint, and test documentation with code style guidelines.
- **Package management:** package.json and package-lock.json for Node.js dependencies (export functionality).
- **Development scripts:** serve.sh for local development server, various test files for debugging.
- **Debug tools:** debug_plugin.php, debug_plugin_loading.php, test_*.php files for development and troubleshooting.
- **Build artifacts:** Build outputs and temporary files managed by build system.
- **Hugo to FearlessCMS Converter:** Python tool for automatically converting Hugo themes to FearlessCMS themes with template conversion, variable mapping, and asset conversion.

## 13. Extension Points

- **Plugin development:** Hook system, admin section registration, custom content types, custom templates/themes, DB integration via MariaDB connector.
- **Theme development:** Modular templates, asset management, theme options, SASS/SCSS, custom JS.
- **Custom handlers:** Custom routing, admin sections, file processors, authentication/permission systems.
- **Static export customization:** export.js can be extended for custom export formats and optimizations.
- **HTML editor extensions:** Custom editor plugins and content processors.

## 14. Deployment Considerations

- **File permissions/ownership:** Set writable dirs to web server user, use 755/644, avoid 777/666, verify file ops.
- **Server config:** URL rewriting, PHP optimization, file upload/security settings, HTTPS enforcement.
- **Security hardening:** HTTPS, file access restrictions, error reporting config, regular audits/updates.
- **Environment config:** Development (debug), production (optimized), maintenance (maintenance mode).
- **Static export:** Use export.js for CDN deployment and maximum performance with full HTML content support.

## 15. Development Workflow

- **Local development:** PHP built-in server via serve.sh, file-based config, direct file editing, debug mode.
